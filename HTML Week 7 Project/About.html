<body>
Well, if you clicked here you want to know a bit more about me. <br/>
I'm a simple man, I don't posses an engineering degree... oh sorry that's Carlin, eh it works though.<br/>
My day to day design job keeps me pretty busy from vehicle wraps to brochures to sticker for FSW students <br/>
I really enjoy solving puzzles and working in teams and while that is seriously cliche it is really what I enjoy doing. <br/> 
If you think you have a graphic puzzle that needs some piecing together I am your guy!
